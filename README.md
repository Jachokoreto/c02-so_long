This is so_long, so I do not plan to put extra effort into it.

# Some nice tools that are helpful

[itcho.io for nice free assets](https://itch.io/game-assets/tag-top-down) - just find one you like and download the pack.

[Sprite cutter](https://ezgif.com/sprite-cutter) - to help you cut out your sprites from the asset pack, remember to cut by tile size, usually 16/32/64.

[PNG to xpm converter](https://anyconv.com/xpm-to-png-converter/) - I used this to convert all my png to xpm.

In case, you wanna rescale your sprites, you can install GIMP(available on Campus' MACs).
1. Go to Image - Scale Image. (Right click anywhere to access the menu)
2. In width add * and the number you want to multiply it by and press Tab. Your new width and height would be calculated now.
3. Select Interpolation: None (this is very important)
4. Press Scale

 For pixel-perfect result the new width and height must be evenly divisible by the old width and height respectively and Interpolation must be None.
